# VBA-challenge
Homework2

Attached are 4 separate VBA files that will produce the desired table per the instructions for each of the tabs (2018, 2019, 2020) in the excel workbook Multiple_year_stock_data_Homework_2.

The order in which the VBA files need to be executed is as follows:
1. Sub Generate_Table
2. Sub StockSummary
3. Sub Calcs
4. Sub Calcs2

Also screenshots are attached of the executed code for each of the years (2018, 2019, 2020) using the same BVA file sequence in each individual tab.

I understand this probably could have been done more efficiently and with less code but that means I wrote it on my own and didn't cheat.

Thank you.
